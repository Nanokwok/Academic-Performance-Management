This repository is a tkinter-based project aimed to facilitate the management of student scores, 
offering features such as adding or removing students, 
grouping them based on test scores, generating basic graphs, and displaying fundamental statistics for individual or 
multiple students.

## Features

- Add or remove students from the list
- Group students based on test scores (students with similar scores stay together, or arrange the scores of all groups to be as similar as possible)
- Generate basic graphs for selected students (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, box plots)
- Display fundamental statistics for individual or multiple students (min, max, average, sum)
- Data storytelling page to visualize student performance and grade distribution
